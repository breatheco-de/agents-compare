  description: "Ability to connect to and interact with an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, including task delegation and external tool access.",
  
  // Extended information for feature pages
  overview: "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables AI coding agents to safely connect to external data sources and tools. MCP servers act as bridges between AI agents and various systems, providing structured access to databases, APIs, file systems, and development tools while maintaining security boundaries.",
  
  importance: "MCP support dramatically expands what AI coding agents can do by allowing them to interact with your specific tools and data sources. This means agents can query your databases, interact with your APIs, use specialized tools, and access project-specific context that would otherwise be unavailable.",
  
  use_cases: [
    "Connecting to company databases to query schemas and data for code generation",
    "Integrating with project management tools like Jira or Linear",
    "Accessing specialized development tools and build systems",
    "Connecting to documentation systems and knowledge bases",
    "Interacting with cloud services and deployment pipelines"

      question: "What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?",
      answer: "MCP is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that provides a standard way for AI assistants to connect to external data sources and tools. It acts as a bridge between AI agents and various systems while maintaining security and access controls."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is MCP support important for AI coding agents?",
      answer: "MCP support allows AI coding agents to access external tools, databases, and services that are specific to your development environment. This dramatically expands their capabilities beyond just code generation to include querying databases, interacting with APIs, and using specialized tools."
    },
    {
      question: "Is MCP secure to use?",
      answer: "Yes, MCP is designed with security in mind. It provides structured access controls, authentication mechanisms, and clear boundaries between what the AI agent can and cannot access. Each MCP server implementation can define its own security policies."
