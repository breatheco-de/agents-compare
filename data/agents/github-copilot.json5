        "question": "What models does GitHub Copilot use?",
        "answer": "GitHub Copilot uses OpenAI's Codex model, which is based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It's specifically trained on code from public repositories to provide relevant code suggestions."

      {
        "question": "How does GitHub Copilot learn from my code?",
        "answer": "GitHub Copilot does not learn from your private code in terms of training its model. It is trained on public code repositories. However, it uses the context of your current file and repository to provide better suggestions, adapting to your coding style without storing your private code."
