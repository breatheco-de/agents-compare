MCP servers act as bridges between AI agents and various systems, providing structured access to databases, APIs, file systems, and development tools while maintaining security boundaries.","importance":"MCP support dramatically expands what AI coding agents can do by allowing them to interact with your specific tools and data sources. This means agents can query your databases, interact with your APIs, use specialized tools, and access project-specific context that would otherwise be unavailable.","use_cases":["Connecting to company databases to query schemas and data for code generation","Integrating with project management tools like Jira or Linear","Accessing specialized development tools and build systems","Connecting to documentation systems and knowledge bases","Interacting with cloud services and deployment pipelines"],"faq":[{"question":"What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?","answer":"MCP is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that provides a standard way for AI assistants to connect to external data sources and tools. It acts as a bridge between AI agents and various systems while maintaining security and access controls."},{"question":"Why is MCP support important for AI coding agents?","answer":"MCP support allows AI coding agents to access external tools, databases, and services that are specific to your development environment. This dramatically expands their capabilities beyond just code generation to include querying databases, interacting with APIs, and using specialized tools."},{"question":"Is MCP secure to use?","answer":"Yes, MCP is designed with security in mind. It provides structured access controls, authentication mechanisms, and clear boundaries between what the AI agent can and cannot access. Each MCP server implementation can define its own security policies."}]},{"id":"context-window","name":"Context Window Management","aliases":["context size","context length","window size"],"category":"Model Support","description":"The maximum number of tokens the agent can process in a single context, including conversation history and file contents.","overview":"Context window refers to the maximum amount of information an AI coding agent can hold in its 'working memory' at once. This includes your conversation history, code files, documentation, and any other relevant context. Larger context windows allow agents to work with more files simultaneously and maintain longer conversations without losing important details.","importance":"Context window size directly impacts how effectively an AI agent can work on complex projects. A larger context window means the agent can analyze multiple files together, understand broader codebases, and maintain context across longer coding sessions without forgetting earlier parts of the conversation.","use_cases":["Working with large codebases that require understanding multiple interconnected files","Refactoring code across multiple modules while maintaining consistency","Debugging complex issues that span several components","Implementing features that require changes to many files","Maintaining context during long pair-programming sessions"],"faq":[{"question":"What is a context window in AI coding agents?","answer":"A context window is the maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that an AI agent can process at once. It includes your entire conversation, any code files you're working with, and other relevant information. Think of it as the agent's working memory."},{"question":"How does context window size affect coding performance?","answer":"Larger context windows allow AI agents to work with more files simultaneously, understand complex relationships between different parts of your code, and maintain longer conversations without losing track of earlier context. This is especially important for large refactoring tasks or debugging complex issues."},{"question":"What happens when the context window is full?","answer":"When the context window fills up, different agents handle it differently. Some automatically summarize earlier parts of the conversation, others might drop older context, and some allow you to manually manage what stays in context. The specific behavior depends on the agent's implementation."}]},{"id":"claude3-support","name":"Claude 3 Support","aliases":["Claude 3","Anthropic Claude","Claude Opus","Claude Sonnet"],"category":"Model Support","description":"Native support for Claude 3 family models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) from Anthropic for code generation and analysis."},{"id":"filesystem-access","name":"Filesystem Access","aliases":["file operations","file system","read write files"],"category":"Execution","description":"Ability to autonomously read, write, create, and modify files in the project directory and beyond."},{"id":"planner-strategy","name":"Planner Strategy","aliases":["planning","strategy","multi-step reasoning","task planning"],"category":"Planning","description":"Advanced planning capabilities to break down complex tasks into steps and execute multi-file changes systematically."}],"matrix":{"cursor":{"mcp-support":{"level":"partial","notes":"Can integrate with MCP servers via extensions and configuration, but lacks native protocol understanding.","examples":["Using MCP extensions for external tool access"]},"context-window":{"level":"yes","notes":"Supports large context windows up to 200k tokens with Claude and GPT-4 Turbo models.","examples":["Processing entire codebases in a single context"]},"claude3-support":{"level":"yes","notes":"Native support for Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku models.","examples":["Using Claude 3 Opus for complex reasoning tasks"]},"filesystem-access":{"level":"yes","notes":"Full filesystem access within the workspace with user permission.","examples":["Creating, reading, and modifying files across the project"]},"planner-strategy":{"level":"partial","notes":"Cursor 'Agent To-dos' feature is automatic, when you prompt it to do something, it will break down the task into steps and execute them one by one.","examples":["Just ask cursor to do something to see examples"]}},"windsurf":{"mcp-support":{"level":"unknown","notes":"MCP support status unclear from available documentation.","examples":[]},"context-window":{"level":"yes","notes":"Supports large context windows through integrated language models.","examples":["Processing large codebases"]},"claude3-support":{"level":"partial","notes":"May support Claude 3 through API integrations but not natively confirmed.","examples":[]},"filesystem-access":{"level":"yes","notes":"Full filesystem access as a native IDE with AI integration.","examples":["Creating and modifying files autonomously"]},"planner-strategy":{"level":"yes","notes":"Advanced planning and autonomous task execution capabilities.","examples":["Multi-file refactoring with strategic planning"]}},"claude-dev":{"mcp-support":{"level":"yes","notes":"Built with MCP support for external tool integration and server communication.","examples":["Using MCP servers for database queries, API calls"]},"context-window":{"level":"yes","notes":"Leverages Claude's native large context window capabilities.","examples":["Analyzing entire codebases in context"]},"claude3-support":{"level":"yes","notes":"Native Claude 3 support as it's built specifically for Claude models.","examples":["Direct integration with Claude 3 Opus and Sonnet"]},"filesystem-access":{"level":"yes","notes":"Autonomous filesystem operations with safety checks and user approval.","examples":["Creating, reading, writing, and deleting files"]},"planner-strategy":{"level":"yes","notes":"Sophisticated planning with step-by-step task breakdown and execution.","examples":["Complex multi-file software development tasks"]}}},"statistics":{"totalAgents":3,"totalFeatures":5,"totalComparisons":15,"lastUpdated":"2025-07-05","supportDistribution":{"yes":11,"partial":3,"no":0,"unknown":1}}}}]}]
