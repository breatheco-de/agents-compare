It includes your entire conversation, any code files you're working with, and other relevant information.

This is especially important for large refactoring tasks or debugging complex issues."},{"question":"What happens when the context window is full?","answer":"When the context window fills up, different agents handle it differently. Some automatically summarize earlier parts of the conversation, others might drop older context, and some allow you to manually manage what stays in context.
